2. Virtualization: Concept, Advantages, and Use Cases
Concept
Virtualization is the technique of creating virtual instances of physical hardware (e.g., CPU, storage, network). A single physical machine can run multiple virtual machines (VMs) using a hypervisor like VMware, VirtualBox, or KVM.

Advantages of Virtualization
Resource Optimization: Better utilization of hardware resources.

Isolation: Each VM is independent, minimizing risks.

Scalability: Easily add or remove VMs as needed.

Disaster Recovery: Snapshots and backups of VMs simplify recovery.

Cost Savings: Reduces need for multiple physical machines.

Use Case Examples
Development and Testing

Developers can spin up VMs with different OSes to test compatibility.

Easily rollback using VM snapshots.

Server Consolidation

One powerful server can run multiple applications as separate VMs.

Legacy System Support

Old software can run on a VM emulating older hardware.

Cloud Infrastructure

Cloud providers like AWS and Azure rely heavily on virtualization to provide scalable resources.

Training and Education

Safe environments to learn OS, networking, or application deployment without affecting the host system.
